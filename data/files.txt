The data consists of static features and temporal features. 
Static features are cropped from each causal indicator's (feature) extracted sparse matrix from shapefile.
Temporal features are obtained by fetching NASA's API AppEEARS and I have saved each test data's bounding box/chunk into a single .npy file.

All the files are too large to include on this repo.

For Static Geographic Features, please find the sparse matrices at

and at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Z33uN0vkqURATXNHGdag37lQtd_dnPYT?usp=sharing 

For Temporal Individual Chunks, please find the individual chunk data at

I have also generated Chunks for the Methodology Revision (lagged data)
